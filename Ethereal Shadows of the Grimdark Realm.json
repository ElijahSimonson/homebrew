				"Umbral Legacy is a silvered longsword with distinctive features that reflect both the shadowy power it embodies and the legacy of VÃ¡cslav's family. The blade is made of polished silver, interrupted by intricate black veins that wind and curl along its length. These veins seem to pulse with an almost imperceptible darkness, hinting at the power contained within.",
				"The hilt of the sword holds a pommel shaped like a stylized crow in flight, with outstretched wings forming the handguards. The crow's beak curves downward, wrapping around the hilt. At the pommel's base, where the crow's tail would be, two deep blue gemstones are set into the metal. These gemstones seem to absorb and radiate a faint, mysterious light."

				"If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.",
				"Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional space created by a {@item Heward's handy haversack}, {@item portable hole}, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened."
